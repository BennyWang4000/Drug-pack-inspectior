In vitro, high concentrations of dipyridamole are required to inhibit platelet function; the necessary concentrations may not be achieved in vivo with recommended doses. There is some evidence that the medication may be more effective in preventing platelet deposition on artificial surfaces (e.g., synthetic prosthetic heart valves) than on natural surfaces. 
Dipyridamole may preferentially dilate, and increase blood flow through, nondiseased coronary blood vessels, leading to a redistribution of blood flow away from significantly stenotic coronary vessels. This “coronary steal” effect increases the differential in perfusion, and consequently in radiopharmaceutical uptake, between regions of the myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries and those supplied by stenotic vessels. Dipyridamole-induced changes in perfusion are similar to those produced by exercise stress.

In vitro, high concentrations of dipyridamole are required to inhibit platelet function; the necessary concentrations may not be achieved in vivo with recommended doses. There is some evidence that the medication may be more effective in preventing platelet deposition on artificial surfaces (e.g., synthetic prosthetic heart valves) than on natural surfaces. 
Dipyridamole may preferentially dilate, and increase blood flow through, nondiseased coronary blood vessels, leading to a redistribution of blood flow away from significantly stenotic coronary vessels. This “coronary steal” effect increases the differential in perfusion, and consequently in radiopharmaceutical uptake, between regions of the myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries and those supplied by stenotic vessels.

In vitro, high concentrations of dipyridamole are required to inhibit platelet function; the necessary concentrations may not be achieved in vivo with recommended doses. There is some evidence that the medication may be more effective in preventing platelet deposition on artificial surfaces (e.g., synthetic prosthetic heart valves) than on natural surfaces. 
Dipyridamole may preferentially dilate, and increase blood flow through, nondiseased coronary blood vessels, leading to a redistribution of blood flow away from significantly stenotic coronary vessels. This “coronary steal” effect increases the differential in perfusion, and consequently in radiopharmaceutical uptake, between regions of the myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries and those supplied by stenotic vessels.

Mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic α-subunit of PI3K (PI3KCA) lead to activation of PI3Kα and Akt-signaling, cellular transformation, and tumor generation. Alpelisib inhibits phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets (including Akt) and demonstrated activity in cell lines harboring a PIK3CA mutation. When compared with either agent alone, the combination of alpelisib with fulvestrant has synergistic antitumor activity in PIK3CA-mutated, estrogen receptor–positive models (André 2019).
